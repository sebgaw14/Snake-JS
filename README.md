# Freestyle JavaScript Game

## Story

By now you know the basics of Javascript. Put your knowledge to the test,
and create something awesome, creative, and motivating.
Your task is to create a game in the browser. What kind of game?

Wait for it...

Any kind :) Your creativity (and your JavaScript knowledge) is the only limit.

## What are you going to learn?

- Finding DOM elements in the document tree.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Handle user interactions with JavaScript event handlers.
- Use HTML data attributes.
- Use CSS styling.

## Tasks

1. Figure out as a team what game you want to work on and what features you want to finish.
    - A game is chosen that the whole team agrees to implement.
    - The game idea is checked by a mentor to make sure it can be realistically implemented in a sprint
    - The game may be based on one of the following ideas: memory card game, Snake, Towers of Hanoi, simple platformer, Flappy Bird, Space Invaders, classic board games, turn based games, etc.
    - There is a backlog of possible features.
    - A plan is created, based on story estimations of what can be finished by the end of the sprint.

2. Create a playable game based on JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
    - The game is based on handling some kind of event(s) (mouse, keyboard...).
    - The game mainly relies on DOM manipulation to move elements around on the screen or change their appearance (beside CSS of course).
    - The code is separated into several JavaScript functions.
